Autonomous Driving Design Using PYTHON with the help of the image processing library openCV
This project aims to use Pasperry Pi with a web cam or a camera attached to it thus the 
project would fist search the image and turn it to gray scale to isolate the noise in the 
background using a threshold value the image would be as simple as a white background with
a black road (or any color combination) this would require the following steps:
1.detect the black road and add a frame to it!
2. add a centroide to the frame
3. connect the dots at least 3 dots are required between the first and last dot
4. this would detect the steering direction and describe how the vehicle's next action!
